sir whenever i want to push some code on git then error occurs "remote origin already exist" every time .
what is the solution of that.

1st Time:
git init
git add <file/folder name>
git commit -m “Your Message”
git branch -M master
git remote add origin <git URL>
git push -u origin master


2nd Time onwards:
git add <file/folder name>
git commit -m “Your Message”
git push



What is "public" class?
If a class declared as public then we can access that class from anywhere .





What will happen if we have not provide any access modifier ?





default class A{
	//ERROR
}

class A{
	//NO ERROR
}

default class A {} === class A {}
